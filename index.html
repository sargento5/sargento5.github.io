			<h2>More Info About Me</h2>
			<p>I don't have too many crazy professional projects, mostly just small ones over the years on amateur platforms. I always liked to play games that allow you to create mini-games within them - one of my favorites being a game called LittleBigPlanet. I do have a passion in game design and in the future I plan to learn programs such as Unreal Engine to expand my knowledge and hopefully create something that relates to my future career in game design.
